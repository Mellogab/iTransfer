# Title: Using Clean Architecture for Bank Transfer API

## Context
Our project aims to develop an API to make bank transfers between customer accounts. This API is critical for the business, as it needs to guarantee the integrity of financial transactions, security of customer data and high availability.

## Decision
We chose to implement Clean Architecture for this project due to the following considerations:

- **Separation of Responsibilities:** Clean Architecture promotes a clear separation of responsibilities between the different components of the system (entities, use cases, external adapters), which allows us to focus on business logic without worrying about details of infrastructure.

- **Improved Testability:** The Clean Architecture framework makes it easier to write automated tests, as use cases and business rules are independent of external frameworks and libraries. This allows us to perform effective unit testing to ensure code quality.

- **Flexibility and Evolution:** Clean Architecture's layered architecture facilitates system evolution over time. We can change specific implementations (for example, database adapters or UI frameworks) without affecting the core business logic.

- **Security and Compliance:** The clear separation between Clean Architecture components helps us implement security layers at different levels (e.g. input validation, etc.) in an efficient and consistent manner.

## Consequences
By adopting Clean Architecture for our bank transfer API, we expect greater maintainability, scalability and reliability of the system. However, this implies a greater initial effort in defining the architecture and educating the team about Clean Architecture principles and standards.

## Alternatives Considered
We consider simpler architectures, such as traditional MVC architectures or microservices-based architectures. However, we chose Clean Architecture because of its ability to maintain simplicity while supporting complex business and security requirements.

This architectural decision record (ADR) serves as useful documentation for the development team and stakeholders, providing a clear understanding of the reasons behind choosing Clean Architecture and its implications for bank transfer API design.
